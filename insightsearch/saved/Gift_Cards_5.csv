These gift boxes, however, are a little more classy than the standard email or printed-off versions at home as it shows you went a little further, the box is very sturdy, and I appreciate the fact Amazon delivers it for free with next day shipping.

174,"04 14, 2014",5.0,"I feel like Amazon should limit what can have a product review. I mean seriously, it's a gift card. I guess if you received it and got a paper cut, you may want to warn people that there is that potential hazard. Or maybe you didn't get the correct design, to which I say again, it's a gift card. You're not getting married to it. You'll most likely toss it when you're done with it. I guess there is the chance that the card is not active when you receive it, but even still, that's not the cards fault, it is the card activator person's fault..we should be able to review them and their performance...'my card's activation seemed to be a little slow, even faulty at times.

You're not getting married to it. You'll most likely toss it when you're done with it. I guess there is the chance that the card is not active when you receive it, but even still, that's not the cards fault, it is the card activator person's fault..we should be able to review them and their performance...'my card's activation seemed to be a little slow, even faulty at times.

398,"04 14, 2014",5.0,"I feel like Amazon should limit what can have a product review. I mean seriously, it's a gift card. I guess if you received it and got a paper cut, you may want to warn people that there is that potential hazard. Or maybe you didn't get the correct design, to which I say again, it's a gift card. You're not getting married to it. You'll most likely toss it when you're done with it. I guess there is the chance that the card is not active when you receive it, but even still, that's not the cards fault, it is the card activator person's fault..we should be able to review them and their performance...'my card's activation seemed to be a little slow, even faulty at times. Maybe the card activator person needs more training.' For the record, my card worked, no paper cut, and the design was perfect!",B0078EPBHI

625,"01 19, 2017",5.0,"As you can see, it's very cute. I ordered different gift cards in various dollar amounts, but I kept each gift card style to the amount the same, i.e. the mini-Amazon boxes contained only $50 gift cards. Thank goodness because each box was shrink-wrapped because there was no indication of the dollar amount on the box itself and I was much too lazy to unwrap them to check them all.

But, if you felt compelled to rip off the shrink-wrap, you can open the box and check because it's not a taped box - it's MAGNETIC!! Yes, the box is held closed by hidden magnetic force, which isn't strong but is strong enough to keep the box closed. Amazing!

I don't know how Amazon makes money off of these clever gift card containers that are shipped, but I'm sure there's some mathematical and habitual wizardry regarding gift cards and spending.

This is a fun way to make gift card giving more fun.",B0091JL3OI

636,"09 7, 2016",5.0,"This review is for the Amazon Gift Card (any amount) in the Mini Amazon Shipping Box:

Do you get excited when your Amazon Shipment arrives at your door? The sight of the brown Amazon box & the excitement of getting a new delivery? If so, then you are going to LOVE the little gift box that this gift card comes in. I've ordered many of the Amazon tins, & some with the greeting cards, & this is one of my favorites!  It is Super Adorable, & a great way to give a gift card for any Amazon Fan!

The little brown box is about 4.5"" x 3"" x 1"" tall. The inside comes with a removable brown flap that holds the gift card perfectly.

Open the flap & it reveals the gift card inside. The top flaps seem like they are magnetic because when you go to reclose they snap back into place. The bottom has a clear window that allows you to see inside. Small print on the back- Amazon Gift cards, made in China. I chose the ""Thank you"" gift card. (see attached pics). This little gift box comes free with the purchase of your gift card. You can reuse it, or swap out the gift card if you choose.

It arrives with inside an outer box, so it should arrive safe & sound.

Would it make a great gift? Definitely!  Amazon is a great card to give because there are So many choices of what to spend it on. Unlike other gift cards where you are stuck to a particular retailer/restaurant. etc, this gives you a variety. I like purchasing gift cards in $25 quantities so I can have a quick gift in hand just in case I need a quick or unexpected gift.

Recommended for:  I recommend this for anyone who loves shopping on Amazon. If you or your gift recipient love getting that Amazon brown box delivery, then you will be giddy when you see this adorable box!

Ideas: You can purchase this & swap out the gift cards. So, for example, it doesnt appear they are still offering the thank you card with this box (like when I bought it).  You could purchase one of the other ""thank you"" gift cards (in box, card, etc), & then purchase a one of these mini box ones & swap the 2 cards. Or use 1 of the gift cards for yourself for future purchases.

At the time I'm writing this review, it appears you can purchase the gift cards in $25-$2000 amounts. There are 2 posts for this particular mini box style with birthday icons & classic white gift card offerings.

Love this little brown box & I will be ordering more. 5 Stars. Happy Shopping! :)",B0091JL3OI

It is two or three shades lighter than shown so looks less classy, in my book.  The picture makes it look as if it is a deep, rich wine color.  And of course, the bow would have to be ironed to look as perky as in the picture.  It comes rather flattened, wrapped in plastic.",B00ADR2XIC

These are great for gifts because recipient has a choice of which restaurant to use the gift card at. We usually go to Chilis & Maggianos at least once a month. Tip: Look for gift card promotions (I've seen some on Amazon Lightening Deals & deals towards the Holidays) & check the restaurants websites for promos too for joining their newsletter/ frequent guest programs. Chilis & Maggianos email coupons occasionally when you sign up for their newsletters, & these can be combined along with using these gift cards.",B00BXLSUF2

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving, so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card. When you are buying a gift card for yourself, it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off.

999,"02 9, 2016",4.0,"UPDATE: 5/31/16

After all the ""hulabaloo"" about an empty Noodles & Co. gift card, I found out from Noodles corporate office customer setvice that you CANNOT enter all the numbers on the back of the gift card to check the balance...only the last 14 numbers from the card. As it turns out, my gift card was fully loaded and ready to use.  Apparently Noodles had several complaints about the issue over the last few months because they added a special note to their gift card page...""If your gift card number has 19 digits, please only enter the last 14 digits of your card number, omitting the first 5 digits."".

**If you recently gifted a Noodles & Co. gift card, please have your giftee recheck their card balance (only enter the last 14 digits of their card number, omitting the first 5 digits) or contact Noodles directly like I did.  You won't regret either transaction.  It would be nice if AMAZON or the gift card seller would add this info to the product description to save time & money for everyone.

The web page is:  [...]

RUNNING LOW? Check your gift card balance anytime! Enter your gift card ID number found on the back of your card in the box below and click on the ""Submit"" button. If it's time to fill up, you can refuel at your neighborhood Noodles & Company.

If your gift card number has 19 digits, please only enter the last 14 digits of your card number, omitting the first 5 digits.

TIP:  Do join the eClub rewards.  You can get free food and get coupons by email.  It's worth the extra little bit of time plus you will learn about new offerings and menu changes.  I especially love the BOGO coupons.  I like to buy a salad and get a second one for the next day or share with a friend.  Gift the card another look.

NOTE: I was not compensated for my review.

I love thee alongside a delightful bucket of peanuts, which always await the hungry steak ordering customer right on the table. I love thee slathered with oh so delicious bourbon glaze or seasoned butter.  I love thee next to the mouth watering fresh yeast dinner rolls, which are served up hastily and a-plenteously!  I love thee, O Logan's, thou great and inexpensive Roadhouse restaurant, which beckons with delightful cowboy decor and a peanut-shell laden floor.  I love your buttery perfection you call broccoli, and I love your chicken and salmon dishes as well.

Hence, I love your most amazing $25 gift card, for which I only have to pay a mere $20.  Now, off to Logan's I go, for a meal fit for two for only $20!

I have never had a bad experience at Logan's.  The steak is always ALWAYS cooked to perfection.  Seasoned just right.  Meat-a-tarians, buy this card!!",B00BXLURUI

I guess if you received it and got a paper cut, you may want to warn people that there is that potential hazard. Or maybe you didn't get the correct design, to which I say again, it's a gift card. You're not getting married to it. You'll most likely toss it when you're done with it. I guess there is the chance that the card is not active when you receive it, but even still, that's not the cards fault, it is the card activator person's fault..we should be able to review them and their performance...'my card's activation seemed to be a little slow, even faulty at times.

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving, so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card. When you are buying a gift card for yourself, it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off. We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20% off as a Lightning Deal which is a great price. Gift card discounts come up primarily during the Christmas shopping season, but this one popped up on the Deals list in May.

1248,"08 19, 2015",5.0,"Honestly, these are great to give to your teens to ensure the money you give them gets used for what is supposed to be used for.  I like giving gift cards to them and know that they are using them for food, not video games or Sephora, cigarettes, or anything they could get into trouble for.  I know they at least are eating if I give them a gift card, not that they couldn't sell it, but, still better than money.  Good for traveling or if you're worried about carrying a purse with you or otherwise getting your cash stolen.  I've never had a problem with one not working, and I usually purchase directly from the local restaurant because they usually have a deal: buy a $25 gift card, receive a 6"" sub FREE.

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving, so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card. When you are buying a gift card for yourself, it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off. We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20% off as a Lightning Deal around Christmas time which is a great price.

You see the image which resembles a wide paper bag? You have to rip that piece of firm cardboard apart to reveal a gift card inside. There is no perforation anywhere, nor can you feel the gift card through the cardboard ""envelope."" The back has a barcode and such, so I thought maybe that was what needs to be scanned at checkout, but no. Again, there's a card inside.

Attached is a picture with a ruler and the gift card next to the cardboard.

The card worked as expected at Whole Foods. Thank goodness I figured out there was a gift card inside because I would've looked really dumb, forcing the cashier to scan the package's barcode, instead of the gift card.",B00ELQD11E

I am not into panhandling or begging since we ( Two Border Collies) set out to move. But when the weather turned cold & food started to run short. The choice was fuel to keep moving or food. Then while at a library. I remembered I have an Amazon Store Card..... Lor got a jacket to stay warm in that matches Holigraph's jacket. Some Purina moist dog for them both. Jack links to share with them, along with Cheezit's. But to look far enough into Amazon & find the section of Gift cards..... OMG!
Got the Domino's Pizza E-Gift card. It came 27 1/2mins after purchase. Then had the Taco Bell & Burger King gift cards sent to my Address on the road. When online at both to check balances after they showed up 24hrs later.

Good to always check the balance, and if you give it as a gift make sure you tell the person to check the balance.

Also, if you look, there are all kinds of specials on the PJ ordering website, such as this one that is going on at the time of this review... it's called ""Pepsi. Pizza. Rock.""  For $12 you get a large 2 topping pizza and a 2 liter drink.  Then, you receive another coupon code for a free product, such as a large pizza or a 2 liter drink.  All of mine thus far, and I do this every weekend for the past month...have been a free large pizza.  On top of all of this, you get Papa rewards, so every 25 Papa Points, you get another free large pizza.  You can't go wrong.  And the pizza is phenomenal.

1954,"07 23, 2016",5.0,"I'm going to have to give 5 stars for this product. I like the fact a gift card let's the  birthday person spend it the way they'd like to. The downside, is that a gift card,  seems alittle impersonal; you couldn't make the choice on what to give someone? I can make a choice, and my choice is to let the birthday person splurge on whatever tickles their fancy. Hence, the gift card. I'm a practical person myself, but I'd probaly loose my mind if I recieved a vacuum or sink mats for my bd. So a gift card is a safe bet. :) The tin is just adorable too, an extra little pop.",B00JDQJZWG
1955,"07 23, 2016",5.0,"Amazon gift card in an adorable cupcake shaped tin- what's not to love? The Amazon card makes a great gift & the bonus tin is ""icing on the cake"". ;)  The bonus tin is about 4"" x 4.5"" & one of the cutest ways to give a gift card as a gift. The inside has a removable black lining insert to hold the gift card. The back has a clear window, & says ""Amazon gift cards"" in very small print.  The tin is reusable & can be used to hold other small items or change. Very nice that Amazon offers this adorable tin with their gift cards.

Amazon gift cards make a great gift because the selection of products offered on this website is Huge!  Unlike giving a gift card to a specific store, restaurant, or for a specific item (i.e. movie tickets, waterparks, etc), an Amazon gift card can be used for whatever the receiver wants. That's a huge perk in gift giving. Other recommendations: Buy it to have on hand as a gift. You never know when you'll be invited to a party or have an event come up where you'll need a quick gift.  No more running around store to store. You'll have this gift on hand.  Another idea- purchase it for yourself. Maybe you know you will want to buy something later in the year. Hang onto the gift card, then you can always easily add it to your account, or right into a family or friends account.",B00JDQJZWG

When I entered my card number it said I had a $0.00 balance so I had to contact customer service. I was told I would receive a refund and to purchase another card. I just placed my order for another gift card and I hope that arrives with the $50.00 balance that it's supposed to have. Be careful and check the balance immediately after receiving the card so you don't wait in a long line at the theater only to be told your gift card has a $0.00 balance.",B00MV9FM9C

2057,"11 20, 2016",5.0,"It's day 78 on the road since we left. Our full story @ earthen_religion on Instagram & YouTube.
I am not into panhandling or begging since we ( Two Border Collies) set out to move. But when the weather turned cold & food started to run short. The choice was fuel to keep moving or food. Then while at a library. I remembered I have an Amazon Store Card..... Lor got a jacket to stay warm in that matches Holigraph's jacket. Some Purina moist dog for them both. Jack links to share with them, along with Cheezit's. But to look far enough into Amazon & find the section of Gift cards..... OMG!
Got the Domino's Pizza E-Gift card. It came 27 1/2mins after purchase. This e-card is BTW the MVP. Cause: Eta could be 5- 30mins for when you get the e-card. Dominos are open until 1am in some places. Once I had the code me & the girls split some Kicker chicken nuggets. Which when living outdoors in a perpetual state. Real food is prized.
 Then had the Taco Bell & Burger King gift cards sent to my Address on the road. When online at both to check balances after they showed up 24hrs later.
This even after the payments I'll end up making is far better than freezing or being hungry.",B00MV9H6VY

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving, so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card.  When you are buying a gift card for yourself, it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off.  We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20% off as a Lightning Deal around Christmas time which is a great price.  Best bet is to keep an eye on the Lightning Deals for gift cards and see if you can snag a good deal.",B00PG8502O

2317,"08 19, 2015",5.0,"We love Olive Garden, and I particularly love Olive Garden for lunch during the work week.  One reason I really love the gift card is that I can use it to pay for both myself and my dining friend better than using cash.  When I am paying with cash, several of my friends argue about it and insist on paying.  Sometimes, I want to pay, and I don't want them feeling guilty or fighting over who is paying.  When you have a gift card, you can just say, ""Let me pay.  I have this gift card.""  They never turn down the offer.

Now, about the restaurant.  I love nearly all the menu items, but I really REALLLLY love the Zuppa Toscana, so I usually get the unlimited soup, salad & breadsticks lunch special for $6.99.  Lunch is served fast and I always can get in and out in under an hour.  They always let me take the rest with me, even happy to provide more soup, salad and breadsticks and box it up, so, since I'm single, that's dinner.  Always great service, and let's not forget the after dinner mints.  YUM!",B00PG8502O
2318,"08 16, 2015",1.0,"Olive Garden overcharged their customers for worst food they made. Upon arrival at a local Olive Garden branch in October 2014, my friends and I saw only a few customers sit there so we should be assigned a seat quickly. There were several welcoming representatives just talking to each other and one told us that we had to wait at least 20 minutes to get seated.

After the dirty and sour meal, we were overcharged and were forced to pay 20% service fee as tips. If it's a good meal and service, we might pay more than 30% of dinner price as tip but we had a horrible dining experience in Olive Garden. After all, we would never visit Olive Garden again because such a bad restaurant kept ripping people off. I have seen bad reviews on this restaurant from other people on other sites too.",B00PG8502O

I bought this to use when we go to the movies and getting $10 free more than compensates for the extra 2 dollar charge for each ticket.  I like getting my ticket before going to the theater since it avoids the line of getting a ticket and since so many theaters now have reserved seating, it is almost becoming mandatory.  If you are running late, having your ticket already is a life saver.  The eticket is nice because I often place gift cards in drawers or weird places and have to go find them.  I can access this ticket on my phone or a computer.  How convenient!",B00PGOMSU0

Jack links to share with them, along with Cheezit's. But to look far enough into Amazon & find the section of Gift cards..... OMG!

2577,"06 16, 2017",5.0,"This is nice for a wedding gift. The envelope is silver print with a white bow, & the back has a clear view window to see the gift card. I plan on putting this in a wedding card as a gift for an upcoming wedding. The top flap opens up, & it has a pull card you pull out to reveal the gift card. At the time of purchase, Amazon is offering this adorable card holder free with a $15.00+ gift card. The gift card is black with the Amazon logo. The envelope is 4"" x 4.5"" x .5 cm.  It will add some weight if you are mailing inside another card, so be sure to check your postage. You can't go wrong with giving gift cards as a gift, & this adorable envelope dresses up your gift & would be great for a wedding or anniversary.

2612,"07 5, 2017",5.0,"I was weary about purchasing this product because of all of those 1-star reviews. I decided to take the plunge, though, because I had $65 on my Amazon Gift Card balance. My Prime membership had expired, I hoped that I could use my Amazon Gift card balance to renew it, but for whatever reason, it doesn't appear to be possible. I wanted to treat myself, though, so I went ahead and took a chance on this e-gift card for Ulta so I could pick up some skin care and makeup necessities. Very glad that I did, despite the reviews. That being said, there are a few things that I have learned from buying e-gift cards on Amazon, and I hope these tips can help. First, for in-person orders, do not bother having them scan the bar code, it never works - instead, just read the numbers off to them, simple. Second, if you copy and paste the 16 digit card number, you will need to manually remove the spaces or else it won't register (that's how it is with Dominos, anyway). Dumb, I know, but if it isn't working, try removing the spaces just in case. Third, when shopping at Ulta.com you CANNOT use more than one gift card. Why is that a problem? Because to use the ENTIRETY of my Amazon balance, I had to purchase two separate cards in the amounts of $30 and $35. I didn't want any remaining balance lingering as I have no idea when I'll have the extra funds to renew my Prime membership. This was an inconvenience because I had to split my Ulta purchases into two separate orders. Fourth, apparently the recipient needs to have an Amazon membership. If you are gifting a young person who isn't able to make an Amazon account you could always send the gift card to yourself and then send the card number and pin to the recipient. I have purchased E-Gift Cards off of Amazon for the following companies: P.F. Chang's, Domino's, Ulta, Panda Express, and Chipotle, and haven't had any issues with any of them. It just sounds like Amazon customer service isn't very good at helping people troubleshoot technical issues Order was successful, and if you are still reading, I really hope that this review has helped you make a decision regarding whether or not to purchase. If you have the time, it is usually worthwhile to go for the physical card, but these E-Gift cards are still quite convenient if you are in a pinch or have a long-distance recipient.",B01CT5PHJ2

This is a nice bonus & a great way to give a Christmas gift. The tin is about 5"" x 4.5"" x 1"", and has a clear window at the bottom so you can see the gift card inside. This one is a bit of an odd shape because of the santa hat shape, but still very cute. :)",B01E4QUN0W

2713,"04 21, 2017",5.0,"Amazon gift cards are nothing new, and they are very handy to give as gifts due to the diverse nature of products Amazon offers  certainly your recipient can find something he / she will like to order. These gift boxes, however, are a little more classy than the standard email or printed-off versions at home as it shows you went a little further, the box is very sturdy, and I appreciate the fact Amazon delivers it for free with next day shipping. If you're going to be spending $50 or more for a gift card, which is the minimum price to have it delivered in a gift box like this, I would recommend you gift this version to your recipients.",B01E4QUN0W
